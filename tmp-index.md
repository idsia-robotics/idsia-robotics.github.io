# About

Our lab is part of [IDSIA](http://idsia.ch) (Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence), affiliated with both [USI](http://usi.ch) (Università della Svizzera Italiana) and [SUPSI-DTI](http://www.supsi.ch/dti/) (Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana, Dipartimento di Tecnologie Innovative). We do basic and applied research in autonomous and mobile robotics, in close collaboration with other IDSIA researchers, namely the [Imprecise Probability Group](http://ipg.idsia.ch/) led by [Prof. Marco Zaffalon](http://people.idsia.ch/~zaffalon/) and the deep learning group led by [Prof. Jürgen Schmidhuber](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/).

We are part of the [National Centre of Competence in Research](https://nccr-robotics.ch) (NCCR) Robotics: a Swiss nationwide organization funded by the [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx) (SNSF) pulling together top researchers from all over the country with the objective of developing new, human oriented robotic technology for improving our quality of life. In the context of NCCR, we routinely collaborate with other swiss robotics labs at [ETH Zurich](http://www.ethz.ch/), [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/) and the [University of Zurich](http://www.uzh.ch/index.html).

# Research

We work with both flying and ground mobile robots; our current research focuses on the following themes:
 - Machine Learning and Deep Learning for challenging problems in robot perception and navigation;
 - Intuitive interaction modalities between humans and robots;
 - Robotics for education;
 - Collaboration and planning in multi-robot systems.
