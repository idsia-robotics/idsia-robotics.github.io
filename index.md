    excerpt: "We apply state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for vision-based quadrotor control in human proximity ([link](https://github.com/idsia-robotics/proximity-quadrotor-learning)) and for traversability estimation for ground robots on challenging terrain ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05368)).  We are also developing self-supervised techniques for autonomously learning to perceive long-range obstacles ([link](https://github.com/Mirko-Nava/Learning-Long-range-Perception)).  We gained widespread media attention for developing deep nets that guide a quadrotor [to follow a forest trail](http://people.idsia.ch/~giusti/forest/web/) (with the [Robotics and Perception Group](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/) at the University of Zurich).  Previously, we released software for robustly [perceiving people from a low-lying viewpoint](http://people.idsia.ch/~giusti/hri14/)"

# About

<figure style="width: 20%" class="align-right"><img src="files/idsia_logo.png"></figure> 
Our lab is part of [IDSIA](http://idsia.ch) (Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence), affiliated with both [USI](http://usi.ch) (Università della Svizzera Italiana) and [SUPSI-DTI](http://www.supsi.ch/dti/) (Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana, Dipartimento di Tecnologie Innovative).

We are active in basic and applied research in autonomous mobile robotics, in close collaboration with other IDSIA researchers, namely the [Imprecise Probability Group](http://ipg.idsia.ch/) led by [Prof. Marco Zaffalon](http://people.idsia.ch/~zaffalon/) and the deep learning group led by [Prof. Jürgen Schmidhuber](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/).

We are part of the [National Centre of Competence in Research](https://nccr-robotics.ch) Robotics: a Swiss nationwide organization funded by the [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx) pulling together top researchers from all over the country with the objective of developing new, human oriented robotic technology for improving our quality of life. In this context, we routinely collaborate with other Swiss robotics labs at [ETH Zurich](http://www.ethz.ch/), [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/) and the [University of Zurich](http://www.uzh.ch/index.html).
